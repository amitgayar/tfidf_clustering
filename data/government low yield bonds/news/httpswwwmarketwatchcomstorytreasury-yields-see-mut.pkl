VU.S. government bond yields for longer-dated debt fell Monday as investors wrestled with the threat of intensifying trade clashes between the U.S. and China and the ripple effects those fresh animosities could have on global markets.\u000a\u000aThe 10-year U.S. government bond yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.05% fell 1.7 basis points to 2.936%, marking its lowest yield since July 25, according to Dow Jones Market Data, based on levels at 3 p.m. Eastern.\u000a\u000aThe 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.94% , meanwhile, gave up 1.2 basis points to 3.081%, also hitting its lowest rate since July 25. Both the 10-year and 30-year yields have seen three straight sessions of declines.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. two-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, -1.19% , which is the most sensitive to shifts in inflation and monetary policy, was virtually unchanged, 0.4 basis points higher at 2.649%. The short-dated maturity on Friday notched its largest weekly drop since the week ended May 25.\u000a\u000aThe differential between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes, known as the yield curve, stood at 28.7 basis points, or 0.287 percentage points, 2 basis points narrower from 30.7 basis points on Friday. Concerns that the yield curve could eventually invert, with short-dated yields moving above long-dated yields, is keeping investors on edge. An inverted yield curve has often preceded a recession.\u000a\u000aRead: Here\u2019s when the yield curve actually becomes a stock-market danger signal\u000a\u000aOn Friday, Treasury yields fell after the closely watched reading of monthly employment for July came in weaker than expected, and China announced retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.\u000a\u000aJuly Labor Department data showed that the economy added 157,000 jobs last month, compared with a 195,000 average estimate in a MarketWatch survey of economists.\u000a\u000aFriday\u2019s economic data looked unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from moving forward with its plans to hike rates as many as two more times in 2018, as early as next month. Wall Street assigns a roughly 94% chance of a rate increase at the central bank\u2019s next two-day gathering ended Sept. 26, according to data from CME Group Inc.\u000a\u000aSeparately, China announced tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. products on Friday, in response to the U.S.\u2019s planned 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. On Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted that tariffs are \u201cworking big time.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.80% fell 1.3% to its lowest level since February 2016, and the China Shenzhen A Share index 399106, +1.11% dropped 2.1%, highlighting lingering concerns about rising tensions over tariffs as well as a sluggish Chinese economy. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.65% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.68% shook off those concerns and rose in Monday trade.\u000a\u000aIn other geopolitical developments drawing the attention of fixed-income investors, the White House said it was reimposing a raft of sanctions on Iran that take effect at midnight Tuesday, as the Trump administration seeks to ratchet up pressure on Tehran. Trump has pressured Iran to rein in its nuclear program. A White House statement said Trump was reimposing sanctions lifted under the \u201chorrible\u201d Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. has withdrawn from.\u000a\u000a\u201cNear-term directional moves in the markets continue to be dominated by headlines around trade and geopolitics. Today is no different as headlines of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran have worked their though the markets driving oil prices higher and putting additional pressure on interest rates,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management.\u000a\u000aHe suggested, however, that a solid batch of economic data and healthy economic reports may keep further rallies for bonds in check.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn the flip side, strong corporate earnings continue to push equities higher as we continue to get closer to the highs we witnessed earlier this year,\u201d Ripley said. Last week, the benchmark 10-year Treasury hit a psychologically significant yield above 3% before retreating in the following days.\u000a\u000aHigher rates have often rattled Wall Street investors because they translate to higher borrowing costs for corporations and undercut the appeal of owning riskier stocks in favor of bonds.\u000a\u000aLooking ahead, fixed-income investors will watch for an auction of three-year, 10-year and 30-year paper throughout the week, totaling $78 billion over the next four trading sessions.
