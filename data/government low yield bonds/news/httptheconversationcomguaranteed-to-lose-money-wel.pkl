VIn 1960 DC Comics introduced the \u201cBizarro\u201d planet of \u201cHtrae\u201d. Created with a duplicating ray, the planet\u2019s inhabitants are all imperfect versions of Superman and Lois Lane, doing \u201copposite of all Earthly things\u201d.\u000a\u000aThey go to bed when the alarm clock rings. They eat only the peel of a banana. They earn degrees by failing subjects. And they invest in \u201cbizarro bonds\u201d that are \u201cguaranteed to lose money\u201d.\u000a\u000aNow the governments of Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland are selling ten-year bonds with negative interest yields.\u000a\u000aThe normal attraction of a bond is that, for an upfront payment, the issuer pays you back more \u2013 paying interest on the principal over a given number of years, and the principal at the end.\u000a\u000aGovernment bonds \u2013 which are the main way governments fund deficits \u2013 have been particularly attractive to investors wanting minimum risk, because a government can generally be relied on to pay its debts.\u000a\u000aBut bonds with a negative interest rate mean bond holders are effectively paying governments to hold their money for them.\u000a\u000aThe existence of these bizarro bonds, and the fact anyone wants to buy them, tells us much about how strange global economics now are, and that expectations are low about things changing any time soon.\u000a\u000aRead more: Explainer: why the Japanese economy is stuck in a holding pattern\u000a\u000aWhy would anyone want to buy such a bond? The main reason is still the same. A government bond is safe. It\u2019s just that now the bond doesn\u2019t guarantee a minimum return but a minimum loss.\u000a\u000aTake, for example, the Swiss government bond that currently costs SFr103.15, pays no interest and will return just SFr100 when it \u201cmatures\u201d in June 2029. The holder knows they\u2019ll lose more than 0.3% over a decade, but no more. A term deposit in a Swiss bank is no better, with interest rates of about -0.3%, and less safe. Buying shares or gold might return more, but carry a bigger risk of losing a lot more.\u000a\u000aRead more: Negative interest rates \u2013 are there any positives?\u000a\u000aFor foreign purchasers there is an additional consideration \u2013 they may be hoping the Swiss franc will strengthen against their local currency \u2013 but for Swiss citizens it largely comes down to paying the government to keep their money safe.\u000a\u000aBond yields reflect a number of factors, but the most crucial one is expectations about short-term interest rates as well as inflation.\u000a\u000aRight now interest rates around the world are at historically low levels, and there is is little expectation they will increase any time soon.\u000a\u000aThis is important because an investor can weigh the value of buying a ten-year bond against any other investment, particularly against buying a one-year government bond and then, when it matures next year, buying another one-year bond, and so on.\u000a\u000aSuppose interest rates are about 1% but everyone buying bonds expects rates to rise. The ten-year bond would then need to offer a yield more than 1% to be competitive with simply buying one-year bonds and rolling them over (on the basis the yield offered will more than 1% next year). The ten-year yield would need to match the average expected returns from one-year bonds over a decade.\u000a\u000aThe market for negative yields on ten-year government bonds in Japan and Europe therefore implies that most investors are expecting near-zero or negative interest rates will be maintained by central banks for some years to come.\u000a\u000aThe yields on government bonds still in positive territory imply something similar. In Australia, for example, where the ten-year yield hit a historic low below 1.3% in June, the implication is that markets expect the Reserve Bank Australia to keep the cash rate at or below its current all-time low of 1% for a considerable period.\u000a\u000aAll this suggests markets are not optimistic about global economic growth (possibly due to concerns about higher US tariffs). It is the same with other long-term interest rates, such as term deposits offered by banks.\u000a\u000aNegative interest rates are extremely rare. Even rates as low as 1% are historically unusual. In his epic study of interest rates, A History of Interest Rates (1963), author Sidney Homer suggests rates lower than 3% were virtually unknown in ancient Mespotamia, Greece or Rome, or in medieval and renaissance Europe.\u000a\u000aBank of England data show there were just three months between 1935 and 2012 when the yield on ten-year UK government bonds dropped below 2%. Since mid-2015, they have not been above 2%, and are now below 1%.\u000a\u000aFor governments, this could be a rare opportunity. It\u2019s an ideal time to borrow. This should make infrastructure projects more economically viable.\u000a\u000aIn Australia, the Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has argued quite forcefully for more spending on infrastructure. \u201cThis spending not only adds to demand in the economy, but it also adds to the economy\u2019s productive capacity,\u201d he said in June.\u000a\u000aBut \u201cdebt and deficit disaster\u201d and \u201cback in the black\u201d rhetoric may mean the Australian government does not seize this opportunity.\u000a\u000aA government doing the opposite of the good advice given to it by a trusted central bank governor would be just what one expects in a Bizarro world.
