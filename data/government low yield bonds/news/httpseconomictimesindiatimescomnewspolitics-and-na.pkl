VYogi Adityanath\u2019s government in Uttar Pradesh opened a Pandora\u2019s box of loan waivers and there seems to be no stopping it. The BJP, perceived by many as a reformist party committed to addressing chronic structural issues, is taking populism to new heights.Loan waivers could prove to be a huge drain for the exchequer and might deal a blow to the creation of much-needed infrastructure in agriculture . The chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Devendra Fadnavis, who seemed to be conscious of this danger, are now being forced to yield to the demand for loan waivers.Who is responsible for this? Are the chief ministers victims of the anti-market policies of the Centre?But first take a look at the serious structural issues that are thwarting agricultural development, especially rain-fed agriculture. Most of the agriculture in the country is rain-fed and saddled by low productivity.This is despite impressive demonstrations for raising the groundwater table, which can be achieved through scientific watershed development. At the least, it will ensure protective irrigation for rain fed agriculture when it is in dire need of a little but timely water. This will ensure minimum productivity level of crop in monsoon (kharif ) and will open up the possibility of an additional crop post monsoon: this will be a game-changer for poor farmers. Public money spent here will offer big and quick returns.A large number of dry-land agriculturists in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are involved in the production of pulses. Not surprisingly, the trigger for the agitation in these states, which has led to the deaths of five people in police firing in Mandsaur, was the failure of the government to protect the floor price of pulses. Pulses have a unique place in rain-fed agriculture. They are the poor man\u2019s crops as they can be cultivated during monsoon even without additional source of irrigation. (Protective irrigation, though, can multiply the productivity.) Because of its nitrogen-fixing properties, pulses also increase the soil\u2019s fertility.Against the backdrop of protein deficiency in the diets of the poor, it makes sense to invest in increasing the productivity of pulses, the cheapest source of protein. The reason for the pathetic state of research into pulses is systemic. Poor farmers find it risky to purchase new seeds every year due to the vagaries of monsoon and the volatility of prices. This takes away the incentive for private investment in research. The result is there are very few hybrids in pulses (hybrids need to be purchased every season).Only public investment in irrigation and price stabilisation can incentivise private-sector research. This brings us to the issue of Minimum Support Price (MSP). How should we look at MSP for rain-fed agriculture: as a form of subsidy that inevitably distorts the market; or as a floor price that will be an incentive to raise productivity, for there is empirical evidence that farmers increase investment through intensive input use and productivity goes up?Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian rightly supports the latter approach. It is essential that the state invests in procurement mechanism for pulses to protect MSP.There is a strong case for aiming at self sufficiency in pulse production as relying on imports is an expensive option. Higher prices for tur in the last two years encouraged many sugarcane growers in Maharashtra to shift to pulse production. There are huge social gains associated with this. This will lead to efficient and more equitable use of water. Protecting MSPs for pulses and even raising them should be a major policy tool to create a win-win situation for poor producers and consumers. Unfortunately, the Centre showed complete apathy towards this. Ignoring the warnings and recommendations of its chief economic advisor, it failed to protect the floor price of tur.The prices slid way below the MSP, damaging the credibility of the government, especially after PM Narendra Modi himself had appealed for the cultivation of pulses. With this, the government has lost a major opportunity to build confidence in farmers in rain-fed areas: a precondition for the big reform in the fields that would shift farmers to more sustainable and efficient agriculture. If the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra now find themselves pushed against the wall on the issue of loan waiver, the blame must squarely go to the Central government. There are three main reasons for farmers\u2019 grievances, apart from the issue of MSP.One, after two successive years of drought, when the farmers hoped for better incomes, demonetisation hit them badly as the prices of their produce fell. Like the rest of the country, farmers too bore the pain, hoping that black money holders will be punished. But even now, some observe that the prices of many vegetables like tomoto, onion and cauliflower never recovered after demonetisation. Two, during the 2014 campaign, Modi had raised the expectations of farmers by promising MSPs that would ensure 50 per cent profit. But that did not happen after he came to power \u2014 and that rankles.Three, the Central government\u2019s frequent ban on onion exports irked the farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Coming back to pulses, the import of tur and a ban on its export, despite it being a bumper crop, caused a downward spiral of domestic prices that added to the farmers\u2019 anger.The ban on tur export, with restrictions on stocking limit by private traders, made it difficult for the Fadanvis government to ensure floor price. With the idea of loan waiver firing the imagination of farmers in different parts of the country, a huge political capital, which the Modi government had in 2014 for carrying out bold reforms in agriculture, seems to have been squandered away.(The writer is an agriculture policy researcher)
