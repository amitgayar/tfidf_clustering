VNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks added to their gains on Tuesday following news of potential progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations, while the pound fell after Brexit hard-liner Boris Johnson won the leadership of Britain\u2019s Conservative Party, clearing the way for him to become prime minister.\u000a\u000aA host of strong earnings gave U.S. stock indexes an early boost, with Dow components Coca-Cola Co and United Technologies Corp both beating second-quarter earnings estimates.\u000a\u000aStocks extended their gains on reports that U.S. negotiators were headed to China on Monday for face-to-face trade talks, a sign of potential progress in the two countries\u2019 prolonged, acrimonious tariff spat.\u000a\u000a\u201cCompany reports have been very good on the whole, but revenue numbers have missed the mark and on conference calls they\u2019re highlighting trade as an issue,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrade has been holding down stocks. If we\u2019re able to resolve it, you\u2019ll see a pickup in global growth.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S.-China trade tensions, along with the prospect of Britain exiting the European Union, or Brexit, without a deal, were cited by the International Monetary Fund as reasons it cut its global growth forecast through 2020.\u000a\u000aThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 177.29 points, or 0.65%, to 27,349.19, the S&P 500 gained 20.44 points, or 0.68%, to 3,005.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.27 points, or 0.58%, to 8,251.40.\u000a\u000aThe European STOXX 600 benchmark rose about 1%, helped by a 6% surge in automakers and growing certainties of policy easing from the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve.\u000a\u000aThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.98% and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.48%.\u000a\u000aThe dollar advanced to a near five-week high against a basket of world currencies, on the heels of a congressional deal to extend the U.S. debt limit for two years, easing fears of a government default.\u000a\u000aBut the British pound lost ground after Johnson, who has promised to lead Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal by the end of October, won the Conservative Party leadership and will replace Theresa May as the country\u2019s prime minister.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time before we can assess (Johnson\u2019s) negotiating skills and what type of deal he\u2019s going to push for,\u201d added Nolte.\u000a\u000aThe dollar index rose 0.49%, with the euro down 0.55% to $1.1146.\u000a\u000aThe pound was last trading at $1.2435, down 0.31% on the day.\u000a\u000aCrude prices rose late in the session following reports that the United States may have shot down a second Iranian drone, adding to escalating Middle East tensions.\u000a\u000aU.S. crude oil futures settled at $56.77 per barrel, up 1%, while Brent Crude futures settled at $63.83 per barrel, up 0.9% on the day.\u000a\u000aU.S. Treasury yields inched higher on renewed trade optimism, and as market participants eyed expected interest rate cuts from ECB and Federal Reserve.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe dollar and Treasury yields quickly picked up as it became a risk-on afternoon,\u201d added Nolte.\u000a\u000aBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.0724%, from 2.043% late on Monday.\u000a\u000aThe 30-year bond last fell 26/32 in price to yield 2.6069%, from 2.57% late on Monday.\u000a\u000aSpot gold prices dropped 0.5% to $1,417.02 an ounce as the safe-haven metal was held in check by a robust dollar.
