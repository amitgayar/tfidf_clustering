VAll eyes are now on how the government structures its foreign currencies bonds sale. JPMorgan is among the top players in this market., CEO ofin India,s tells ET's Saikat Das and MC Govardhana Rangan in an interview how the country should prepare and what it could achieve. Edited excerpts:The official numbers do show that there is a certain amount of economic slowdown. The Budget has tried to kick-start both consumption and investment. There are measures on the investment side encouraging private-public partnerships, infrastructure focus and creating more capacity in the banking system to lend. If these initiatives are executed, investment should revive.Consumption has definitely seen a little bit of slowdown as is seen in the auto sales numbers and a few other industries. Hopefully, this will correct. Consumption slowdown has been a combination of demand and supply issues. On the consumption side, there is a delay in discretionary spending. Supply issues are last mile issues in terms of financing that the NBFC sector was fulfilling. NBFCs played a crucial role in funding the stock in trade, the distributors, individual retail financing in large part of the country. Budget has addressed some liquidity issues that NBFCs faced.It was not the only measure. There are multiple measures that are being taken. Public sector banks have actually stepped in doing a lot for the sector in terms of buying loan portfolios. The securitization market has been active. Liquidity is combination of multiple measures. Some NBFCs are accessing international markets even as domestic liquidity sources have been a little shy.The fact of the matter is we have tapped foreign portfolio investors more for equity than for debt. The amount of debt we draw from offshore market participants is fairly low. Giving access to FPIs either in offshore or onshore market is something that we have the headroom to do. Doing overseas bonds is beneficial for banks and corporates in terms of developing a benchmark yield curve, bringing in long tenor funds, a new class of long term investors and inclusion in global Sovereign Bond indices. There is likely to be significant demand when one of the best emerging markets issues sovereign bonds in the international markets.What is available in the international market is funds across multiple tenors upto 30 years. We will be able to benefit from raising funds at longer tenors at fixed rates at a point when international bond market rates are at a historic low. The decision to whether we need to take the exchange rate risk and how much do we balance in internationalising the rupee and opening the onshore markets versus the offshore markets is the one that the government and RBI will have conferred with each other on.As a global investment bank that has worked with many sovereign and quasi sovereign issuers, we are confident that there will be significant demand for what the government proposes to issue overseas. Clearly a multi-tranche issuance brings in different classes of investors. There will be a range of foreign portfolio investors and real money accounts. In long tenor tranches, you will have pension funds, and insurance companies and in the medium tenor buckets, there will be asset managers and others. From an issuer perspective, it should see that such multi-tranching works well for it.Many experts including former RBI governors and eminent economists have spoken about things that we need to do, strengthen infrastructure before we do this. A policy infrastructure should be set in place before we tap the overseas market. One of the issues is liquidity. Also, we need to take care of exchange rate risk and the impact on the forwards market premiums. Any global event can impact any emerging market sovereign bond\u2019s secondary trading. These are all legitimate risks that will need to be managed.PSU Banks play a very prominent role in reviving the investment cycle. The capital is useful to address legacy issues, to give a fillip to growth and to meet global capital norms. If the government announcement on capital infusion (Rs 70,000 crore) is frontloaded, it will be useful to kickstart investments and consumption cycle.
