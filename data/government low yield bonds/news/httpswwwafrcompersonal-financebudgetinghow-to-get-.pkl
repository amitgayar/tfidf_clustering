VSelf-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) and other self-directed investors often rely on a grab-bag of yield stocks rather than take a diversified fund approach. They do not realise they can get 6 per cent yield or more in an income-managed fund at lower risk.\u000a\u000aThis is no time for complacency. After strong gains this year, Australian shares are 20 per cent overvalued (on a market-weighted basis for the S &P/ASX 200 index), according to Morningstar.\u000a\u000aWarnes is especially wary of utilities, infrastructure and listed property companies \u2013 the so-called \u201cbond proxies\u201d - that outperform when interest rates fall. The S &P/ASX 200 A-REIT index's total return is 22 per cent over one year to July 2019 and several infrastructure and utility stocks and funds have rallied.\u000a\u000a\u201cAcross the market, yield stocks have become expensive,\u201d Warnes says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how companies in a sluggish economy can maintain high dividend payout ratios. We will look back on 2019 as the high watermark in dividend ratios, which will make it even harder for income investors.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs equity valuations rise and risks intensify, the prudent strategy is holding more cash in portfolios, Warnes says. \u201cI expect global equities to fall by 20 per cent in the next big downturn, so it is pointless chasing a 5 per cent yield. Preserving capital should be the priority.\u201d\u000a\u000aWarnes\u2019 bearish view is no comfort to investors who live off portfolio yield. Adding more cash and fixed interest to portfolios as a defensive tactic makes sense, but it is a drag on income, with many bank term deposits and Australian government bonds yielding under 2 per cent.\u000a\u000aEven that is looking relatively attractive as more countries head towards negative interest rates. Germany is selling 10-year government debt with a negative yield for the first time in three years and France, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland have joined the club of countries, headlined by Japan, with 10-year bonds at negative interest yields.\u000a\u000aMore than $US13 trillion ($18.6 trillion) is invested in negative-yield bonds worldwide, according to Bloomberg, as investors effectively pay these governments to hold their money. Negative yields signal distress for the global economy, yet equity markets continue to rally.\u000a\u000aClime Asset Management executive director, John Abernethy, says the \u201cJapanification\u201d of investment markets will spread to more European countries and ultimately Australia. He expects some form of quantitative easing (QE) in this market as rates head towards zero from the current cash rate of 1 per cent.\u000a\u000aIf Abernethy is right, more countries will have sluggish economic growth, negative interest rates, barely any inflation and engage in QE, a form of unconventional monetary policy that increases money supply to encourage lending and investment, and risks creating asset bubbles.\u000a\u000a\u201cInvestors should be prepared for a sustained, low-yield cycle for at least the next few years,\u201d Abernethy says. \u201cIt is hard to see what will drive inflation and interest rates higher and get yield heading up. We are stuck in a world of low, rolling growth and mild downturns.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbernethy expects income funds that invest in bank term deposits, corporate debt and fixed interest to deliver a total average annualised return of just 4 per cent over five years. A blended portfolio (half in an income fund, half in a growth fund that holds equities), will return 6 per cent annually in that period.\u000a\u000aHigh asset prices are the main culprit for lower future yields. \u201cA number of listed property trusts now trade at a significant premium to their net tangible assets (NTA),\u201d Abernethy says.\u000a\u000a\u201cBond prices have been bid up and yields have fallen significantly. Infrastructure assets have rallied and their forward returns will compress. High total returns from these assets in the past year, mostly because of capital growth, are an aberration.\u201d\u000a\u000aRetail investors will have to lower income expectations. They expect the All Ordinaries index to yield 4.3 per cent over the next 12 months, according to the latest Investment Trends Investor Intentions Index. Yield expectations have risen slightly since March 2019 and are the same as a year ago, despite slowing economic growth and two local rate cuts.\u000a\u000aInvestors expect a 6.1 per cent total return from Australian shares over 12 months, according to Investment Trends. Most of that return will come from yield; capital growth will be scarce. \u201cThe trend for yield expectations is heading lower, but not by much,\u201d says Investment Trends research director, Recep Peker. \u201cRetail investors have high demand for yield, but are struggling to find ways to achieve it.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is not all bad news. Dr Don Hamson, managing director of Plato Investment Management, believes a diversified portfolio of quality Australian shares can yield 6 per cent this year after franking. The Plato Australian Shares Income Fund is targeting a 9 per cent gross return, including franking.\u000a\u000a\u201cAttractive dividends from resource companies, particularly iron ore miners, will boost overall yield in Australian equities and there is talk of special dividends in the resources sector,\u201d Hamson says. \u201cBalance sheets are collectively in good shape and the risk of dividend cuts is low. Blue-chip shares are a no-brainer for income investors seeking high, fully franked yield.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlato\u2019s dividend-cut model forecasts the probability of a dividend cut for each dividend-paying stock in the S &P/ASX 300. When this model is aggregated across stocks, it shows the dividend outlook for the Australian sharemarket. The model is tracking close to the lowest probability in the past 16 years for dividend cuts, and puts the odds at less than 5 per cent.\u000a\u000aPeter Bolton, a former investment adviser and editor of yeildreport.com.au, which tracks yield across asset classes, says the best short-term income strategy is to live off capital.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith yields falling and prices elevated, the smart approach is to draw down on capital for income rather than take riskier bets on yield\u201d, he says. \u201cThere is nothing wrong in living off capital after a period when asset prices have risen. That is better than being pushed further and further along the risk curve for yield, a strategy that probably will end in tears.\u201d\u000a\u000aBolton says income investors should focus on risk first and return second. \u201cToo many investors do the opposite: they fixate on the yield needed to maintain their lifestyle and choose assets that pay that yield, regardless of risk. A better approach is determining the level of risk you will take, finding assets that match that risk profile and accepting the return.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe news is grim for investors in bank term deposits (TDs). Two-year deposits from the four major banks range from 1.6 to 1.9 per cent and are expected to head lower. With Australia\u2019s headline inflation rate at 1.3 per cent in the March quarter, many TD investors face negative real returns.\u000a\u000aCash exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are an alternative for investors who want to increase their portfolio cash exposure without locking money away in TDs. Cash ETFs are bought and sold like a share on ASX but typically return a little less than one-year TDs.\u000a\u000aThe BetaShares Australian High Cash ETF and the iShares Core Cash ETF are the main fund options for investors seeking greater liquidity in their cash exposure.\u000a\u000aSeveral Australian government bond funds have performed well over 12 months, most of the return coming from higher bond prices as yields have fallen.\u000a\u000aThe Mercer Australian Sovereign Wealth Bond has starred with a total return of 11.5 per cent over 12 months. The Jamieson Coote Active Bond fund had a 10.4 per cent in that period and the Vanguard Australian Government Bond Index Fund returned 9.98 per cent.\u000a\u000aThese are outstanding returns given the risk profile of government bonds but are unlikely to be repeated in the next 12 months without a slew of further domestic rate cuts.\u000a\u000aFixed-interest ETFs have boomed this year as more money flows into them and issuers launch products to meet market demand for yield.\u000a\u000aThe Russell Australian Government Bond ETF returned 12.01 per cent over 12 months to June 2019, ASX data shows. The iShares Treasury ETF returned 10.59 per cent and the SPDR S &P/ASX Australian Government Bond Fund 10.52 per cent.\u000a\u000aLike unlisted Australian government bond funds, fixed-interest ETFs are unlikely to provide the same return in the next 12 months but are a useful tool for investors seeking low-cost government bond exposure through an ASX-quoted ETF.\u000a\u000aConservative income investors can use corporate fixed-interest funds that hold investment-grade bonds. Investors with a higher risk profile could consider funds that invest in sub-investment-grade bonds in Australia and overseas. This form of corporate debt has a greater risk of default but typically has higher returns.\u000a\u000aIn investment-grade bonds, the Vanguard Australian Corporate Fixed Interest Fund has a gross return of 8.08 per cent over one year to June 2019. It invests in bonds issued by Australia\u2019s major banks, offshore banks, property trusts and other lending institutions.\u000a\u000aNeuberger Berman\u2019s NB Global Corporate Income Trust is part of a new breed of listed funds in Australia that offer exposure to global high-yield corporate bonds \u2013 a $US2.7 trillion market.\u000a\u000aListed on the ASX in 2018, the trust holds a portfolio of sub-investment-grade bonds from up to 350 companies, including Netflix, Dell, Hertz and Virgin Media. The goal: a 5.25 per cent annual return (after fees) paid monthly, with low volatility.\u000a\u000aWith many of Australia\u2019s largest investment-grade corporate bonds yielding less than 2 per cent after bond price increases, the NB Trust\u2019s targeted return and fund diversification appeals, provided investors can tolerate higher risk.\u000a\u000aThese yield-focused funds are arguably the best option for income seekers. Some invest mostly in Australian and global fixed interest, others in high-yield credit, property or shares.\u000a\u000aThe RARE Infrastructure Income Fund returned 19 per cent over one year, boosted by stronger demand for global infrastructure stocks, amid falling interest rates. Core infrastructure suits conservative investors but could underperform when interest rates rise.\u000a\u000aThe Plato Australian Shares Income Fund delivered 15.1 per cent in income (including franking credits) over one year to May 2019 and has returned 9.6 per cent in yield annually since inception in September 2011. The Vanguard Australian Shares High Yield Fund Retail is another diversified income with attractive yield over five years.\u000a\u000aConservative investors could choose multi-sector income funds that invest across asset classes and offer greater diversification. But they yield less because of their fixed-interest allocation.\u000a\u000aListed on ASX, hybrid securities have elements of debt and equity. Like bonds, they promise to pay a fixed or floating rate until maturity. Unlike bonds, the amount and timing of interest payments are not guaranteed and hybrids can be converted into shares.\u000a\u000aHybrids are complex and do not suit inexperienced or risk-averse investors. Prospective investors attracted to hybrid yields from major banks and other issuers should invest through a hybrid managed fund that specialises in this market.\u000a\u000aA specialist hybrid manager, Elstree Investment Management, has delivered a 9.66 per cent gross return over 12 months to June 2019 through the Elstree Enhanced Income Fund. It holds up to 40 hybrids and its default risk is consistent with lower-investment-grade securities.\u000a\u000aHybrid returns are falling as the gap between the median trading margin on hybrids and the three-month bank bill swap rate compresses. The margin, about 2.5 per cent, is near its 2014 low, implying returns of under 4 per cent from many hybrids.\u000a\u000aLarger LICs are popular with conservative income investors who want yield from a diversified portfolio of Australian equities through low-cost active funds.\u000a\u000aThe market\u2019s largest LICs, Australian Foundation Investment Company (AFIC), Argo Investments and Milton Corporate, are yielding about 4 per cent, before franking. WAM Capital yielded 7.6 per cent at the end of June, ASX data shows.\u000a\u000aAs closed-end funds, LICs can trade at a premium or discount to underlying net tangible assets (NTA). Persistently larger discounts to NTA are a problem for investors, but can also be an opportunity in higher-quality LICs that revert to their average premium or discount.\u000a\u000aAFIC traded at a 6.8 per cent discount to NTA at the end of June, ASX data shows. Argo traded at a 3.8 per cent discount and Milton a 4 per cent discount.\u000a\u000aIn theory, investors can buy AFIC, Argo and Milton at a discount to their underlying asset value and potentially capitalise on weaker LIC sentiment this year. Buying quality LICs when they trade at a discount to NTA can reduce valuation risk for yield seekers.\u000a\u000aA growing number of yield-focused ETFs have emerged in the past few years. They provide low-cost exposure to yield strategies, but extra care is needed with smart-beta ETFs that use rules-based strategies to enhance yield rather than replicate a market-weighted index.\u000a\u000aThe iShares S &P/ASX Dividend Opportunities ETF had a trailing yield of 7.14 per cent at the end of June 2019, ASX data show. It provides exposure to a basket of 50 high-yielding stocks.\u000a\u000aThe UBS IQ Morningstar Australian Dividend Yield ETF aims to replicate the price and yield performance of Morningstar\u2019s model income portfolio, consisting of 25 stocks. Its trailing yield is about 4.9 per cent and one-year total return (including capital growth) is 11.6 per cent.\u000a\u000aOne of the first yield-focused ETFs, the Russell High Dividend Australian Shares ETF, had a trailing yield of 8.5 per cent in June 2019 and total return of 11.7 per cent. The Vanguard Australian Shares High Yield ETF has been another solid performer.\u000a\u000aAs with any ETF, it pays to understand the composition and methodology of the fund\u2019s underlying index. Some yield ETFs invest in small and mid-cap stocks to enhance capital growth, increasing risks. Others are based on analyst stock recommendations and model portfolios.\u000a\u000aSimilar returns from yield ETFs are unlikely in the next 12 months after the market\u2019s rally this year and as the average market yield edges lower. But yield ETFs have their place for investors seeking diversified yield exposure through low-cost, ASX-quoted funds.\u000a\u000aP2P funds match companies seeking debt capital from non-bank lenders and retail investors who want to invest in an individual loan or pool of loans, potentially earning a higher return compared to fixed interest, albeit with higher risk.\u000a\u000aThe market\u2019s largest P2P lender, La Trobe Financial, has a range of commercial and residential property investments around Australia. Several current La Trobe P2P investments in NSW promote net returns about 6.5 per cent over 12 to 15 months. Platinum Mortgage Securities is another channel to invest in mortgage securities.\u000a\u000aInvestors in property-based P2P funds must be comfortable with potential default risks if borrowers cannot repay their loan and property prices falls.\u000a\u000aInvestors who believe property values are stabilising and the risk of loan defaults is easing because of rate cuts, might find extra appeal in P2P platforms in mortgage securities. They suit experienced, risk-tolerant investors who understand the risks of property lending.
