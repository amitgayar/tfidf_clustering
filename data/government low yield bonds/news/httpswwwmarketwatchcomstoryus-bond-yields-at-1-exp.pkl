VWith German 10-year bunds closing last week with a yield of zero \u2014 it has been as low as minus 0.08% in the past two weeks \u2014 talk of a yield-curve inversion and a global recession is rampant as some short-term interest rates in the U.S. did drift for a short time above the 10-year Treasury yield.\u000a\u000aStill, the classic 2-10 spread, or the difference in yield between 2-year TMUBMUSD02Y, -1.19%  and 10-year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.05%  never inverted and \u2014 until it does \u2014 the jury is still out on the possibility of the present U.S. economic expansion ending.\u000a\u000aThe issue may very well be that international demand for Treasuries in a year of record supply is rather strong. There simply isn\u2019t any significantly positive yield in any key global government bond market, so bond buyers end up piling into the U.S. Treasury market (see chart).\u000a\u000aGerman 2-year federal notes TMBMKDE-02Y, -0.14% which go by the tongue-twisting name Bundesschatzanweisungen, have been in negative territory for five years and closed last week at minus 0.57%. That means the German 2-10 spread is a positive 57 basis points as subtracting one negative number from another results in a positive interest-rate differential. Japan faces a similar situation, where 10-year Japanese government bonds TMBMKJP-10Y, -0.69%  closed the week at minus 0.03% while 2-year Japanese government bonds TMBMKJP-02Y, +1.10%  closed at minus 0.15%.\u000a\u000aNegative yielding 10-year government bonds in major world economies are a clear sign of global deflation where overly indebted developed economies are struggling to grow. Meanwhile, the overly indebted Chinese economy has trouble picking up the slack, despite some improvement of late. The headline inflation rate in both the U.S. and Germany is 1.5%, while German economic data, such as industrial production, is noticeably weaker (see chart).\u000a\u000aRead: China investment, markets recovery to boost global economy later in 2019, IMF says\u000a\u000aIt is no wonder the Federal Reserve has removed itself from the picture by clearly saying they will be on the sidelines for a while when it comes to the fed funds rate. When it comes to ongoing quantitative tightening (QT) via the run-off of bonds from the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, it looks like it will stop by the end of this year, as per Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s statements. It is amazing how $1.3 trillion in Treasury supply, courtesy of the Trump tax cuts combined with $500 billion run-off cap from the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, cannot get the 10-year Treasury yield to even a measly 3%.\u000a\u000aThere appears to be a \u201chead-and-shoulders\u201d top in the 10-year Treasury yield, to use trading terminology, which \u201cbroke\u201d at 2.6%. The \u201chead\u201d is 3.25% so the gap measures 0.65%, or 65 basis points. If the fascinating world of chartology is any indication, this chart says the 10-year note yield is headed to 1.95%, which is a heck of a lot weaker than most investors, including myself, expected at the beginning of the year (see chart).\u000a\u000aI do not make decisions based on charts alone, but I have never met a futures trader who does not know how to read a chart. And there is a lot of futures trading going on in the Treasury market and the euro-dollar and fed funds market. They all say the Fed is done. In my view, this decline in 10-year note yields is much more due to a weak global economy than any issue with the United States.\u000a\u000aThe next time there is a recession, I think the 10-year Treasury yield will likely break 1%, given the willingness of the U.S. central bank to engage in such unorthodox monetary policies. Based on the present low level of unemployment in the U.S. and largely pro-growth White House economic policies, there is not going to be a recession in the U.S. this year, but when it comes to 2020 or 2021, a lot can change.\u000a\u000aIn theory, this sharp decline in global bond yields catalyzed by the Fed being \u201con hold\u201d and weak data in Europe, and previously China, should be bullish for gold bullion and emerging markets. That\u2019s often the case when Fed tightening cycles end. In theory, an end to Fed tightening should be bearish for the dollar \u2014 but not this time.\u000a\u000aI think the dollar has more upside because the euro and the Chinese yuan have more downside. The European Central Bank is proceeding with more quantitative easing (QE), which is euro-bearish, and coupled with the epic Brexit disaster is bound to push the euro EURUSD, -0.1166%  lower. By the end of the euro weakening cycle, it is conceivable that the euro falls below parity (1:1) to the dollar. The interest-rate differentials are dramatically in favor of the U.S. dollar, and while the Fed is in QT mode, the ECB is in QE mode. Parity is only a matter of time in such a scenario.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese yuan USDCNY, -0.0509% on the other hand, is not part of the U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.01% Still, China was in a very sharp slowdown, which was catalyzed (but not caused) by tariffs and trade friction. Because of the deflationary nature of too much debt in the Chinese financial system, it is entirely plausible that the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) decides to devalue the yuan, as it did in December 1993, when they did so to the tune of minus 34%. At the time, there was a sharp recession in China that was not officially acknowledged, but it showed up in secondary (i.e., undoctored) banking loan-loss data. A yuan devaluation should be seen as a measure of last resort and probably would not happen unless all other means of intervention have been exhausted.\u000a\u000aIn 2019, there is much more at stake as the Chinese economy is nearly 20 times larger than it was in 1993 and its level of indebtedness is at least four-fold higher. Still, It doesn\u2019t look like the present sharp economic slowdown in China will end up like a Second Asian Crisis this year, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is where China is ultimately headed. (For more, see \u201cChina\u2019s hard landing? Watch prices on these 3 things, not economic data.\u201d)\u000a\u000aEven though this head-and-shoulders top in the Treasury yield is pointing to 1.95%, it looks like the Chinese yet again crammed enough new loans down the throat of their financial system as mandated by their infamous lending quotas. Recent Chinese economic numbers have again begun to improve, which is evident in commodity prices. It does not look like Treasury yields are headed much lower right away, despite this head-and-shoulders top.\u000a\u000aIvan Martchev is an investment strategist with institutional money manager Navellier and Associates.
