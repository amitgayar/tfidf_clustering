VThe head of the world\u2019s largest bond fund says investors shouldn\u2019t read too much into the recessionary signal coming from the U.S. Treasury market.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with MarketWatch, Daniel Ivascyn, group chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, said too many market participants were watching for an economic downturn by monitoring the twists and turns of the yield curve, which saw the rate on 10-year Treasurys fall below the 3-month Treasury bill yield on March 22, marking the first such inversion since 2007.\u000a\u000aAn inversion of the 10-year/3-month measure of the curve has been highlighted by researchers at the San Francisco Fed as a highly reliable recession warning signal, typically preceding a downturn by more than a year.\u000a\u000aHowever, Ivascyn says investors have become overly anxious about recessionary signals despite evidence that the domestic economy remains solid. He said decelerating U.S. growth and lower terminal interest rates did point to falling yields, but he felt the recent rally was overstretched.\u000a\u000aBesides growth concerns, the investment manager instead sees other factors that have contributed to the phenomenon of long-term yields falling below their short-term counterparts. He said a combination of technical factors including increased demand for longer-dated Treasurys because of a sharp uptick in mortgage refinancing applications may have amplified a recent bond-market rally, helping an inversion form even as the tight labor market and global growth outlook has yet to point to an imminent end to the U.S.\u2019s second-longest expansion since World War II.\u000a\u000aRead: The yield curve inverted \u2014 here are 5 things investors need to know\u000a\u000aThe catalyst for the yield-curve inversion were lost on market participants, with the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.68%  falling nearly 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.65%  gave up 1.8% on March 22.\u000a\u000aEquity markets have since staged a modest rebound, but the angst over the implications of the inversion to markets and the economy has spurred a litany of articles and analysis from market pundits.\u000a\u000aSee: Yield curve \u2018overrated as an indicator,\u2019 says Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller\u000a\u000aIs a recession in the cards?\u000a\u000aIvascyn says by Pimco\u2019s own estimation, the risk of a domestic economic contraction this year is limited, even if recent data hint at some weakness taking hold. A final reading of gross domestic product on Friday indicated that the U.S. economy grew at annual pace of 2.2% in the final three months of 2018, a slower than earlier estimate of 2.6%\u000a\u000aStill, the Pimco executive says Treasury investors\u2019 increased pessimism over the U.S. economic outlook comes despite ultralow unemployment rates and a global economy that he believes will be steady in 2019, even if some cracks have appeared lately. Pimco is anticipating full-year GDP between 2% to 2.5%, which is roughly in line with economists\u2019 consensus estimates polled by MarketWatch estimates for 2.3%.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven where our unemployment rate is currently, [a recession], holding all else equal, shouldn\u2019t be much of a concern,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we look at the yield curve shape relative to our economic outlook, [the yield decline] is a bit overdone at least on the short-term,\u201d said Ivascyn. Responsible for the firm\u2019s Income Fund PIMIX, +0.00% which manages more than $115 billion in assets, Ivascyn took over as chief investment officer for Pimco after the acrimonious departure in 2014 of investing luminary Bill Gross.\u000a\u000aThe severity of the fall in yields for long-dated government debt has drawn as much investor attention as the inversion.\u000a\u000aThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.05% slumped nearly 27 basis points in March to trade at 2.42%, marking its biggest monthly decline since Dec. 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\u000a\u000aThe decline in yields, reflecting higher debt prices, can indicate bond investors anticipate lackluster growth, in turn, and subdued concerns about inflationary pressures that would erode fixed-income gains.\u000a\u000aSee: Bond market\u2019s March madness leaves Treasury yields on track for biggest monthly drop since 2016\u000a\u000aRead: This time, an inverted yield curve suggests the stock market has already peaked, some analysts say\u000a\u000aHe added the recent Treasury yield decline appeared to be driven more by bond buyers ramping up their debt purchases for technical reasons rather than those rooted in genuine recession concerns.\u000a\u000aIvascyn credited refinancing of home loans as at least part of the factor that has underpinned March\u2019s bond-market rally.\u000a\u000aHe explained that as rate-hike expectations have faded, U.S. households have moved quickly to take advantage of the decline in fixed-income mortgage rates, which are pegged to benchmark Treasury yields. At current borrowing rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage, around 30% of such home loans are eligible for refinancing, based on Pimco\u2019s calculations. The current 30-year rate fell to 4.07% last week.\u000a\u000aTreasury purchases from real investment trusts, banks and other holders of mortgage-backed securities, reeling from the increased prepayments from homeowners rolling over their loans at lower rates, are some of the players involved in these mortgage related trades.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the first time in a while we\u2019ve seen a big pick-up in these technical flows,\u201d said Ivascyn. The Pimco investor knows a thing about mortgage debt, having burnished his reputation as an astute investor during the 2008-09 financial crisis by buying up beaten-down mortgage bonds as the housing market imploded.\u000a\u000aAlso check out: Mortgage rates plunge at the fastest pace in a decade as growth fears resurface\u000a\u000aMore recently, an uptick in refinancing activity has meant that some of the underlying loans in mortgage-backed securities are being paid off early, shortening the average maturity of their fixed payments and reducing the interest earned from the mortgages. To hedge against the risk of diminished incomes from home loans, holders of mortgage-backed securities buy Treasurys with extended maturities, pushing their yields lower in a feedback loop of bond buying.\u000a\u000aApplications to refinance home mortgages jumped 12% in the week ending March 27, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\u000a\u000aBefore last week, these so-called negative convexity inflows were considered a thing of the past, a powerful force when the Fed had yet to engage in quantitative easing and had, at one point, owned a third of agency mortgages \u2014 meaning those residential mortgage bonds tied to government-linked agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 bonds outstanding.\u000a\u000aUnlike private investors, the central bank doesn\u2019t look to make money from its MBS holdings and so doesn\u2019t hedge its $4 trillion balance sheet against the vagaries of interest rates.\u000a\u000aWith the housing market staging a come back from last year\u2019s doldrums, Ivascyn said he was sanguine on mortgage bonds and less interested in corporate debt, an increasingly popular trade among yield-hungry investors who anticipate low interest rates across the world will keep borrowing costs low and mute defaults. New-home sales rose nearly 5% in February to an annual pace of 667,000, an 11-month high.\u000a\u000aBased in Newport Beach, Pimco managed around $1.7 trillion at the end of 2018.
