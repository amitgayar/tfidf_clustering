VThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Monday it would pump 360 billion rupees ($4.95 billion) into money markets in October in its latest attempt to stem fears of a cascading credit crunch, pledging to buy back bonds after the government dramatically reduced its own borrowing by 700 billion rupees on Friday.\u000a\u000aBond yields dropped sharply on Monday to their lowest in more than a month as investors took in the news.\u000a\u000aThe benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped as much as 12 basis points to 7.90 percent in opening deals, its lowest level since Aug. 29. By 0535 GMT however, it was down 7 basis points at 7.95 percent.\u000a\u000a"Markets are cheering after a long time. The cut in borrowing and the (bond buying) open market operation have both helped equally," said Harish Agarwal, a fixed income trader with First Rand Bank in Mumbai.\u000a\u000a"But I fear profit booking will keep it between 7.95-8.00 percent levels," he added.\u000a\u000aThe RBI said early on Monday that it has decided to buy a total of 360 billion rupees worth of government bonds under its open market operations (OMOs) this month, in a bid to ease liquidity conditions in the market.\u000a\u000aThe RBI's open-market operation announcement followed news on Friday when government said it would borrow a gross 2.47 trillion rupees ($34.08 billion) from the market between October and March through dated securities, lower than budgeted estimates.\u000a\u000aThe government will effectively cut its market borrowing by 700 billion rupees due to higher-than-expected earnings of 750 billion rupees through its small savings scheme.\u000a\u000aThe RBI said that its assistance plan followed an assessment of "durable liquidity" needs and the seasonal growth in currency in circulation ahead of upcoming holiday celebrations.\u000a\u000aThe auctions would be conducted during the second, third and fourth week of October, the RBI said.The 360 billion rupee OMO amount stated was indicative and RBI retained the "flexibility to change it, depending on the evolving liquidity and market conditions".\u000a\u000aIn the foreign exchange market, the partially convertible rupee however was trading weaker at 72.80 per dollar versus its previous close of 72.54 as higher global crude oil prices weighed on sentiment. The unit had touched a record low of 72.99 per dollar last month.\u000a\u000aTraders will continue to monitor domestic markets for further cues ahead of the RBI monetary policy meeting at the end of the week.\u000a\u000aGet Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.
