VIndia\u2019s 10-year bond yield has fallen from its September 2018 peak of 8.18% to 7.22% in December 2018 due to falling oil prices , increased trading activity in the bond market and a stabilising rupee in the international market. However, the favourable bond market trend may reverse in the coming months due to the expected fiscal slippage following the interim Budget , which may lead to surge in government expenditures.Bloomberg\u2019s survey of 41 economists predicts an average 10-year bond yield close to 7.5% for 2019. The composite Bloomberg average is 7.46%. The government has proposed cash handouts to farmers and income tax cuts for the middle class that are likely to create a fiscal mismatch.A Bloomberg Intelligence report published after the Budget expressed concerns over the government\u2019s revenue projections and termed them too optimistic. Such expenditures are likely to hit capital expenditures, negatively affecting the performance of industrial and capital goods sectors.GST revenues have not yet stabilised and shortfalls in collection will impact the government\u2019s tax revenues.To fund expenditures, the government is likely to borrow over Rs 7 lakh crore in 2019-20, which will create an additional supply of bonds in the market. On the other hand, banks already hold ample government securities, weakening their buying appetite.The banks, especially those that have recently came out of the prompt corrective action (PCA) would be eager to offload their government securities to meet rising credit demand. In addition, market participants are expecting a slowdown in RBI\u2019s bond purchases after it recently announced rupee-dollar swap auctions.Low demand coupled with excess supply may prove negative for bond prices and lead to increase in yields. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. When new bonds are issued at a revised rate, prices of old bond react, which in turn affect their yields.For example, the market price of Rs 1,000 face value bond at a coupon rate of 8% will come down to Rs 800, if a new bond comes in the market with a coupon rate of 10%. This is because at 10%, a newly issued bond with a face value of Rs 800 will fetch the same interest payment of Rs 80 that the previously issued Rs 1,000 face value bond was generating at 8%. On the other hand, if a new bond is issued at a lower coupon, say 6%, the market price of the old Rs 1,000 face value bond will increase to Rs 1,333.Apart from the demand-supply dynamics, rising oil prices also pose a risk to bond yields. After touching $50.5 a barrel in the last week of December 2018, the price of Brent crude has gained over 33% and currently trades at $67.2 a barrel. US sanctions on Venezuela and Iran are fuelling oil prices. If oil prices continue to rise, it will prove negative for the country\u2019s current account deficit and stoke inflation concerns. Such developments may create upward pressure on bond yields.The bond market may witness some relief from the RBI in the next monetary policy review as experts feels that lower inflation and moderating economic growth may induce the central bank to cut interest rates further. Says Saurabh Bhatia, Head, Fixed Income, DSP Investment Managers, \u201cWe expect RBI to cut repo rate by 25 bps. As we head into the next quarter, liquidity conditions would be far better what we have seen in the third and fourth quarters of 2018-19. Lowering of repo rate and easing liquidity conditions augur well for short end bond yields to stay lower.\u201dRajeev Radhakrishnan, Head, Fixed Income, SBI MF, adds: \u201cImprovement in external market sentiments with respect to EM assets, change in RBI rate stance leading to potential rate action in April and benign inflation prints provide a favourable backdrop for interest rate markets.\u201dHowever, there are concerns on the long-term bond yields. \u201cThe onset of the new fiscal will see the government supply gaining pace. We expect the yield curve to remain steep,\u201d says Bhatia.A steep yield curve implies that differential between long-term and short-term interest rate is widening. In other words, the yields of long-term bonds are rising faster than the yields of short-term bonds. Generally, a steep yield curve at times of moderating economic growth and low inflation expectations is surprising. As per theory, such market conditions should lead to the flattening of the yield curve. The steepness indicate that the markets conditions are not favourable for the long-term bond market.If factors do play out as expected, the rising long-term bond yields will make corporate borrowings costlier, hitting the profit margins of companies. Moreover, the performance of long-term gilt funds will be negatively impacted as their NAVs decline with falling bond prices (or rising yields). Performance of other investment instruments like NPS-government securities options will also get impacted.However, investors of some small savings schemes whose interest rates are linked to longer maturity bonds may expect some relief. PPF investors may also expect rate hikes due to rising long term rates. According to the Bloomberg Intelligence report, the share of small savings funds in financing the Budget deficit has increased sharply from 2.5% of Budget deficit in 2014-15 to 18.5% in 2019-20. Greater reliance on small savings means that the government will have to continue offering higher deposit rates relative to bank fixed deposits.
